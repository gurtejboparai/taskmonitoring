                <h4>Did any features work better than expected?</h4>
- In iteration 3, we added a new feature to mark a task as completed and it turned out to be better than expected. Initially, we planned on adding the delete task option only which would allow the users to delete a task after completing it. But that didn't quite justify the purpose of our app. As a user too, we would prefer to see the tasks we have completed for self motivation. To fulfill this purpose, we added a "swipe right to left" option to mark a task as completed and push the task to the bottom of the list with the title crossed with a horizontal line. This feature made the list of tasks look more organized, having both the uncompleted tasks on the top and the completed tasks on the bottom.

              <p class="tm-2-col-text-description">
                From our Iteration Velocity Chart, we can see the time we actually spent
on our project nearly twice as long as we estimated for Iteration 1.
The main reason for this is because most of us are new to the android studio and not familiar with each other.
We assigned work without understanding each others' strengths and weaknesses, misjudged the situation led to this result.
For Iteration 2, we made progress based on Iteration 1. We started it early to avoid the previous case
(unclear division of labour and uneven workload) from happening again. We made it, but we met other problems simultaneously.
Debugging and made HSQLDB work cost us tons of time, which we have never expected,
which is why we improved than before but still have some gap between the estimated time
and actually spent time. By learning the lessons of the previous two iterations,
we did an excellent job in Iteration 3.
Although we lack one teammate, the time
we actually spent on our project is less than what we
estimated, we organized everything well, and everyone did their
job perfectly. The success of Iteration 3 tells us good communication
and clear cognition are two essential factors for teamwork,
which is what this course teaches us besides the theoretical knowledge.
