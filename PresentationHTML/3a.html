            <h4>What was the overall architecture of your system (particularly if it is different from the demo system)?</h4>
            The overall architecture for the system is 3 tiers layer where we have storange, interface and logic layer.
            The way we design the architecture is not change much from the demo. However, we change element in each layer
            since during the course we learn that GUI can have storange and logic to maintain the work flow of GUI too. Hence,
            while develop the system throughout each iteration, we move element, mark them up and make sure they in the right place
            of architecture layout. For example, when we create a notification for the app. This feature most likely dealing with
            interface layer. However, we realize that some class actually is for storange the object (Channel.java), and some act
            as logic layer in architecture design (NotificationTask.java). Hence, we divide them and store them in package that mark down
            whatever layer they belong so we have better orginization in the group work.
            <h4>Did any features work better than expected?</h4>
            - In iteration 3, we added a new feature to mark a task as completed and it turned out to be better than expected.
            Initially, we planned on adding the delete task option only
            which would allow the users to delete a task after completing it.
            But that didn't quite justify the purpose of our app.
            As a user too, we would prefer to see the tasks we have completed for self motivation.
            To fulfill this purpose, we added a "swipe right to left" option to mark a task as completed and push the task to the bottom of the list with the title crossed with a horizontal line. This feature made the list of tasks look more organized, having both the uncompleted tasks on the top and the completed tasks on the bottom.
            <h4>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h4>
            - Team work is hard and your team not come together naturally, it requirement the work and responsible
            of individual to the team to make the project happen and go well. After this finish this course, we learn that
            something you plan as initial plan might be change, and your team need to be prepare for the flexible of changes
            as well as cooporate with each other to finish the project. We will start on planning ahead and assign works
            on some dynamic IDE that everybody in our team can see task work and assign them by themselve. Moreover, we will
            start to communicate more in the team to see what is the strength of each member while working on the project, since some group
            member good at communicate, some good at coding for the base code, some good at GUI etc. In contrast, we will stop just left the big
            and difficult work as 1 chunk and let for one member to handle it. Instead, work need to be divide equally and people can choose to the work they comfortable with.

                From our Iteration Velocity Chart, we can see the time we actually spent
                on our project nearly twice as long as we estimated for Iteration 1.
                The main reason for this is because most of us are new to the android studio and not familiar with each other.
                We assigned work without understanding each others' strengths and weaknesses, misjudged the situation led to this result.
                For Iteration 2, we made progress based on Iteration 1. We started it early to avoid the previous case
                (unclear division of labour and uneven workload) from happening again. We made it, but we met other problems simultaneously.
                Debugging and made HSQLDB work cost us tons of time, which we have never expected,
                which is why we improved than before but still have some gap between the estimated time
                and actually spent time. By learning the lessons of the previous two iterations,
                we did an excellent job in Iteration 3.
                Although we lack one teammate, the time
                we actually spent on our project is less than what we
                estimated, we organized everything well, and everyone did their
                job perfectly. The success of Iteration 3 tells us good communication
                and clear cognition are two essential factors for teamwork,
                which is what this course teaches us besides the theoretical knowledge.
