**Note while run the app for iteration 3**

- The app need to run on Nexus 7 to be able to use all the button and display all the feature.
- New feature added in i3: sorted tasks by priority or day, notification of task with high priority in the day,
swipe right to change status of task to complete and it will move to the end of list, swipe left to delete task.
- Talk about the scope of the project: the project has been change during each iteration. We are combine few features together 
in order to make the app run smoothly and meet requirement: 
    - The calender view now been added to the add feature and edit feature (when you choose date, the calendar will show up).
    - The view task detail was combine together with view task list - the list of task will appear on main page with all detail of the task
    - The priority will only use as high or low and it will give the user feature of notification on the day of task with high priority.
    - The task status now is "on going" or "complete" - user swipe right to the status
    - User can delete task by swipe left
    - User can also sorted task by day and priority
    - User can view task base on category - There 6 categories available 
  
- Some possible bug that we found and have been push to the "imagination" i4:
    - When you delete task/change task status or change status in sub categories - the app will automatic move you back to "ALl task"
    - The app work in landscape - but when you move back to horizontal (there will be some lagging and need to exit the add/edit and go back to see the order of object again).

- Feature that we will push for future development:
    - Recurring task
    - Report task progress
    - Add sticker/picture to task
