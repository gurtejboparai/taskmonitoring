# Task Monitor
## Vision statement
The Task Monitoring System will be used to schedule tasks and events for daily, monthly or yearly based on personal need. The system will display all the activities that have been scheduled in a day. Thus, the system will monitor people about upcoming events in their schedule. In addition, it also maintains information about tasks that have been completed, in progress and in waiting. 

The system is mainly designed for busy people, such as: students, office workers, mom, etc., who need a simple tool to organize their activities. The system will allow people to create, view and modify their personal task list. Furthermore, people can also set the reminder with alarm for important events, so that the system will remind them about the event.

The system is also designed for people, who want to adopt new habits or new diets. People who want to adopt new habits can plan out their activities for each day, and time that will be spent for each activity, so that they can slowly get used to the habit. People who want to start a new diet can use the system to track their exercise time, set reminders for taking vitamins, etc. Moreover, the system will allow people to schedule the same activity on multiple days. Hence, it decreases the hassle for people who use it.

The main function of the system is scheduling and planning. Therefore, the system will organize the activities that have scheduled based on their time in the day as default mode. Moreover, the system will also have the option to organize tasks based on their resource, dependencies, priory. The system will need to maintain the accurate information for each task, which include title, date, time, priority (optional), description (optional), and status of task (completed, in progress, in waiting). 

In the paper protocol of the system, it only offers people the task list of activities/events within their status, name, time, priority. Thus, the system is also designed as a desktop application, but we plan to extend the system to mobile application.

This system will have a significant improvement over the paper protocol of the system in use. The system will provide a calendar that offers people a broad view about their current month or year activities, yet itâ€™s easier for people to schedule the activities. Moreover, the system also provides a better interface that is suitable for every type of user. The system will offer people some features to modify the interface to suit with their personal preference, such as: people can change font size, people can change colour of text, people can add pictures or stickers for each task, etc. As a result, people can keep track of their work, people may have motivation to finish their task, and never let important tasks slip out. Thus, people can access important details for each task by just a click or a tap. Since the software will be developed for both desktop and mobile applications, people will have time to time notification, and stay above their task list.

The system will be considered a success if every type of user prefers the system over their note or reminder application from their phone and laptop. However, by personal preference from our group, we would like to have a monitoring application that will handle all our tasks for us.
