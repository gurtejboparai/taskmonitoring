The sample project is the main source for our group to design the skeleton for the project. Moreover, our project also resembles a basic three tiered architecture, which can be shown in our code. Our source code is divided primarily into three major directories. These are Presentation, Persistence and Objects. In addition, these also roughly correspond to the three layers of our programs architecture, that being the Interface layers, the Logic layer and the Storage layer. Our group believes the largest directory is the presentation folder, which handles the implementation of the graphic user interface (GUI). Thus, in this folder, we have the major file, AddTask.java, which handles the creation of new tasks based on user input. Moreover, the presentation folder also contains viewTaskActivity.Java, another important file, which displays a list of previously created tasks, which are separated in hard coded categories chosen when a task is created. Tabfragement and tabspageradapter help with this. EditTask allows the user to change aspects of tasks that have already been created. The new file for our interface layer that we added for this iteration was NotificationTask class. This creates and displays a notification for high priority tasks to the user. The second largest directory is the Objects directory, which handles most storage. The most important file in this directly, and arguably the entire project, is the Tasks.Java file. This file stores all values that are related to a task, such as its name/title, a description of the task, both the start and end time, the date it is supposed to occur on, as well as the priority (high or low) and whether the task is finished or not. Also in the storage layer is the ListTask file, which stores the task in different lists based on the category. Our storage layer also has the new channel class, which creates a notification channel for our notifications mentioned earlier. For our logic layer, the most important file AccessTask, which handles communication between our storage and interface layers. These include adding editing and removing tasks. It also performs several other duties, including comparing tasks so they are sorted correctly for the user.
