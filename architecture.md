# Architecture
The sample project is the main source for our group to design the skeleton for the project. Moreover, our project also resembles a basic three tiered architecture, which can be shown in our code. Our source code is divided primarily into three major directories. These are Presentation, Persistence and Objects. In addition,  these also correspond to the three layers of our programs architecture, that being the Interface layers, the Logic layer and the Storage layer. Our group believes the largest directory is the presentation folder, which handles the implementation of the graphic user interface (GUI). Thus, in this folder, we have the  major file, AddTask.java, which handles the creation of new tasks based on user input. Moreover, the presentation folder also containTaskActivity.Java, another important file, which displays a list of previously created tasks, yet it gives options to manipulate the various tasks, such as editing them, delete them. The second largest directory is the Objects directory, which handles most storage. The most important file in this directly, and arguably the entire project, is the Tasks.Java file. This file stores all values that are related to a task, such as its name/title, a description of the task, both the start and end time, the date it is supposed to occur on, as well as the priority (high or low) and whether the task is finished or not. In addition, we also handle Day class, which will give us flexibility in checking for the day and giving the monitor if needed in the future design.
